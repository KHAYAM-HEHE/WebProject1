# MIC Game - Quick Strategy Guide

## ?? Quick Start Guide

### Your Mission
Destabilize **PureLand** by reducing their stability below 30% OR increasing insurgency above 70% while surviving 5-year performance reviews.

### Win Conditions
- **Victory**: PureLand Stability < 30% OR Insurgency > 70%
- **Defeat**: Review Score < 60 OR Budget < $0

---

## ?? Understanding Your Stats

### Player Resources
- **Budget**: Your operational funds. Refills annually with $100,000
- **Spy Network**: More agents = better success rates and lower costs
  - Optimal: 15-20 agents
  - Cost: $500/agent/year
- **Reputation**: Your standing (0-100). Higher = better review scores
- **Deep State Influence**: Protection during reviews (0-100)

### Review Score Formula (Pass = 60+)
```
Your Reputation
+ Success Rate Bonus (up to +25)
- Detection Penalty (-2 per detection)
+ Deep State Protection (up to +33)
+ PureLand Damage Bonus
```

## ?? Phase-by-Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-2)
**Goals**: Build infrastructure, learn mechanics
- Expand spy network to 15-20 agents
- Execute 2-3 low-risk operations per year
- Build deep state to 30+
- **Avoid**: High-risk operations, getting detected

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Expand Spy Network
2. Economic Sabotage
3. Form Deep State Connections
4. Bribe Politicians

**Expected Review Score**: 65-75

### Phase 2: Acceleration (Years 3-6)
**Goals**: Significant PureLand damage
- Execute higher-impact operations
- Target stability and insurgency
- Maintain review score above 65
- **Watch**: Detection count, AI aggression

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Fund Insurgency (2-3 times)
2. Engineer Crisis (once)
3. Economic Sabotage
4. Form Deep State before Year 5 review

**Expected Review Score**: 60-70

### Phase 3: Victory Push (Years 7+)
**Goals**: Win condition or prepare for next cycle
- High-risk operations acceptable
- Push stability below 40 or insurgency above 60
- Use deep state protection
- **Critical**: Monitor AI counter-operations

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Engineer Crisis (multiple times if budget allows)
2. Fund Insurgency (aggressive)
3. Any operation that helps win condition
4. Accept detection risk

**Expected Review Score**: 55-65 (rely on deep state)

## ?? Understanding AI Behavior

### AI Threat Response Levels

**Low Threat** (Your doing well)
- AI focuses on economy and development
- Natural recovery of stability
- No counter-operations

**Moderate Threat** (AI is concerned)
- AI increases security moderately
- 20% chance of minor counter-op
- Small financial losses possible

**High Threat** (AI is alarmed)
- Major security buildup
- 40% chance of counter-op
- Can lose 1-3 agents and $8,000-$15,000

**Crisis Mode** (AI is panicking)
- Maximum response
- 60% chance of major counter-op
- Can lose 2-5 agents and $15,000-$30,000

### AI Counter-Operation Triggers
- High threat level (based on PureLand stats)
- Multiple detected operations
- Low PureLand stability/high insurgency

### AI Recovery Mechanisms
- Insurgency suppression (stronger when insurgency is high)
- Security improvements after detection
- Chi-Han and I-Walk provide support
- Economy/stability natural recovery

## ?? Pro Tips

### Budget Management
- **Never** let budget drop below $30,000
- Keep $50,000+ reserve for emergencies
- Reduce spy network if budget is critical
- Annual budget is $100,000

### Detection Management
- Each detection:
  - Costs -5 reputation
  - Increases AI aggression
  - Adds -2 to review score
  - AI improves counter-intelligence

- **Limit detections to 2-3 per 5-year cycle**

### Spy Network Optimization
- **10 agents**: Starting level, expensive operations
- **15 agents**: Sweet spot, good balance
- **20 agents**: Optimal, best success rates
- **25+ agents**: Expensive maintenance, diminishing returns

### Review Preparation (Year 4-5)
1. Check current review score (visible in UI)
2. If below 60:
   - Execute successful operations
   - Build deep state connections
   - Reduce detection risk
3. If above 70:
   - Continue aggressive operations

### Emergency Recovery
**If budget < $40,000**:
1. Reduce spy network to 10-15
2. Skip a year (End Turn without operations)
3. Wait for annual budget
4. Execute only cheap operations

**If review score < 55 and review in 1 year**:
1. Form Deep State Connections (2-3 times)
2. Execute only high-success operations
3. Avoid all high-detection operations
4. Focus on successful completions

## ?? Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-Expanding Spy Network**
   - 25+ agents is wasteful
   - High maintenance costs
   - Diminishing returns

2. **Ignoring Review Score**
   - Check it constantly (shown in UI)
   - Don't wait until review year

3. **Too Aggressive Early**
   - Builds AI counter-measures
   - Increases detection
   - Depletes budget

4. **Neglecting Deep State**
   - Critical for review survival
   - Provides +33 points max
   - Build to 50+ before reviews

5. **Poor Budget Management**
   - Running out of money = instant loss
   - Always keep reserves
   - Reduce network if needed

6. **Ignoring AI Signals**
   - AI tells you what it's doing
   - Counter-ops mean slow down
   - Adjust strategy accordingly

## ?? Winning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Stability Collapse
**Target**: Reduce PureLand stability below 30%

**Method**:
1. Engineer Crisis (multiple times)
2. Economic Sabotage
3. Trigger Border Skirmishes
4. Let insurgency naturally grow

**Timeline**: 7-9 years

### Strategy 2: Insurgency Victory
**Target**: Increase insurgency above 70%

**Method**:
1. Fund Insurgency (repeatedly)
2. Bribe Politicians (weakens government)
3. Economic Sabotage (creates unrest)
4. Avoid detection (AI suppresses insurgency)

**Timeline**: 8-10 years

### Strategy 3: Combined Approach (Recommended)
**Target**: Both metrics simultaneously

**Method**:
1. Balance all destabilizing operations
2. Fund insurgency while damaging economy
3. Engineer crises for maximum impact
4. Build deep state for review protection

**Timeline**: 8-11 years
