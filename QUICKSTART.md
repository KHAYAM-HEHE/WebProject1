## Critical Tips

### ?? Budget Management
- Each operation costs $15,000 - $35,000
- Spy maintenance: Network Size × $500/year
- Don't expand network too large (sweet spot: 15-20 agents)

### ?? Operation Selection
**High Impact**: Engineer Crisis, Fund Insurgency
**Low Risk**: Economic Sabotage, Trigger Border Skirmish
**Strategic**: Deep State Connections, Expand Spy Network

### ??? Avoid Detection
- Detection hurts reputation (-5 points)
- Detected operations increase AI counter-intelligence
- Larger networks reduce detection risk

### ?? Review Preparation
You'll be reviewed every 5 years. Score formula:
```
Score = Reputation + 
        (Success Rate × 50 - 25) + 
        (Deep State / 3) + 
        (PureLand Damage / 3) - 
        (Detected Ops × 2)
```

**Target**: 60+ to pass

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

? **Don't**: Spam expensive operations without considering budget
? **Do**: Plan 3-4 turns ahead with budget in mind

? **Don't**: Ignore deep state connections until it's too late

## Advanced Tactics

### The "Diplomatic Isolation" Strategy
1. Sabotage PureLand-ChiHan relations
2. Bribe Chutki-Ban to your side
3. Trigger border conflicts with OutDia
4. PureLand becomes isolated and unstable

### The "Economic Collapse" Strategy
1. Focus on economic sabotage operations
2. Poor economy ? less ability to fight insurgency
3. Poor economy ? public support drops
4. Cascading failure ensues

### The "Corruption Cascade" Strategy
1. Bribe politicians repeatedly
2. High corruption ? poor governance
3. Poor governance ? instability
4. Instability ? easier for insurgency to thrive
