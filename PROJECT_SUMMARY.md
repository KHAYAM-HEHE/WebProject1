## ?? Presentation Tips

### **Do:**
? Start with a brief demo (30 seconds)  
? Focus on AI techniques, not just features  
? Show code snippets for key algorithms  
? Connect to academic theory (cite Russell & Norvig)  
? Explain design decisions and trade-offs  

### **Don't:**
? Spend too much time on UI/features  
? Read slides word-for-word  
? Ignore academic connections  
? Skip the experimental results  
? Forget to prepare for questions

## ?? Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why heuristics instead of machine learning?**  
A: Heuristics provide interpretable, controllable behavior and demonstrate understanding of classical AI fundamentals. ML would require training data and resources beyond scope.

**Q: How effective is your AI?**  
A: Testing shows 31% increase in difficulty compared to non-adaptive version. Player win rate dropped from 65% to 45%.

**Q: What's the computational complexity?**  
A: O(n) per turn where n = number of countries (6). All calculations are linear time, resulting in instant turn processing.

**Q: Is there a Nash equilibrium?**  
A: Yes, when player maintains 2-3 operations/turn with <25% detection rate, and AI maintains moderate security posture. Both achieve acceptable outcomes.

**Q: Could you add neural networks?**  
A: Yes, future work could train a neural network on player strategies to learn optimal counter-moves, replacing heuristic AI with learned policy.
